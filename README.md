Web Monetization with a Chat application.

[Click here for live Demo](https://dfoderick.github.io/money-chat/)

## How to use it
You should already have a [Coil Account](https://coil.com/) with the Coil browser extention installed. 

Log into app with any name. Payment pointer is optional but recommended if you want to earn money.

If there are no other users online then you can open the chat in a separate browser to simulate multiple users.

> :warning: **All messages are sent to all users of the app. Only use the app for testing and demostration purposes.**

When you are chatting with another user then you are sending payments to them. When some else connects to you to chat then they are sending you payments.
